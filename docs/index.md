# Royal Choice
### Alternate Realities Project by Marta Pienkosz and Jasmin Shi

The main character of the story is a little princess, a member of the royal family. The royal family is elected by **dynastic and divine laws** and has partial immortality. Rulers are able to live up to 300 years, guaranteeing long-term prosperity and justice to their subjects.

The theme communicated by history revolves around the age-old moral dilemma - what's better, do a **good thing for a bad result** or do a **bad thing for a good result?**

## Plot
The little princess wakes up in her chamber. At the beginning of the story, we learn about the identity of the princess and her role in the royal family. Suddenly we hear a sound resembling a bird crying and together with the princess we decide to follow the sound and investigate where it comes from. The princess leaves her room and moves down the corridor towards the basement of the castle. The sound of flapping birds' wings intensifies.

In the basement, she discovers a room full of cages and learns that a special serum is obtained from magical birds. The princess realizes that she consumes a drink that grants “immortality” every day. She talks to an employee who explains the king's logic behind abusing the birds. Confused, she doesn't know what to do - she is faced with the decision to release the birds and expose the king's secret, or keep this information to herself.


## Progress
After brainstorming the project idea, we wrote a brief list of features we want to develop over the next 7 weeks, agreed on the order of implementation and minimal requirements for the MVP. Marta started our project by creating her own resources using [Shapr3D Software](https://www.shapr3d.com/)for each scene. Jasmin worked in parallel on the Github Collaborate and XR Rig setup, as well as creating scene transitions.

## Lobby
We have implemented a simple UI system in the lobby that shows the title, authors, and a brief instruction. We have designed the user path in a way that the user can learn to navigate in a VR environment, try the SnapTurn on turns, test RayCast interactions, and learn about the transitions between scenes that occur when the user stands on an emissive star.


## Bedroom

Add somewhere a sentence: Marta designed Bird NPC and added animations using mixamo 
 

## Corridor
The corridor scene serves as a transition between the two narrative driven scenes. In this scene, we wanted the users to immerse themselves in the game's environment and aesthetics, while also trying to strengthen their sense of anticipation and curiosity. After adding the custom assets, we started scripting the movement of the platforms, which activates when the user stands on the emissive star. Marta encountered difficulties detecting collisions between the XR Rig and the Box colliders. After some time we changed the logic behind this interaction and added Teleport Anchor along with the Hover Exited events. We also created a custom Shader Graph for water, as well as added an element of fog, subtle sounds of earthquake and water to further enhance the sensational feeling.
